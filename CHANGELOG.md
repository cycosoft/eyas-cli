# v4.0.0

- Split project into "Eyas for Desktop" and "Eyas CLI"

# v3.5.1

- Update dependencies
- Fix loading config files when the consumer is type module. Add an alert on how to fix.

# v3.5.0

- Added support for loading tests via the web using a custom protocol. An `eyas.json` will be created in the source directory to deploy with your build. Share tests with users by swapping the https protocol for eyas. (e.g. `https://branch-42.example.com/test` becomes `eyas://branch-42.example.com/test`). This will open Eyas and load the test.
- Added a demo at [eyas://demo.eyas.dev](eyas://demo.eyas.dev) to showcase the new feature.
- Created [launch.eyas.dev](https://launch.eyas.dev) to allow users to open tests in Eyas via a shareable URL. An example using the above demo would be [https://launch.eyas.dev/demo.eyas.dev](https://launch.eyas.dev/demo.eyas.dev).
- Fix loading resources that use other non-active test domains in an Eyas.

# v3.4.1

- As Electron@31.3.1 does not support the file upload progress event in the renderer process, Eyas will polyfill this event to simulate the progress bar. It attempts to get more accurate after each use, but will never match the actual progress.
- Dependency updates
- Fix animations freezing when hiding the UI layer
