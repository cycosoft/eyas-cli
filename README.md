## The Pitch

Bundle your app from any branch, and share it with stakeholders to test your changes using [Eyas Desktop](https://github.com/cycosoft/Eyas/releases). Reduce and simplify the feedback loop before merging. Less bugs, faster deployment cycles, reduced stress.

- 🎨 A/B Test Design Changes
- 🚀 Get Pre-Merge QA Sign-Off
- 🌍 Test Against Any Environment
- 📢 Get Early Customer Feedback

## Install

```bash
# Install the CLI
npm install @cycosoft/eyas --save-dev
```

## Configuration

The CLI will attempt to run without a configuration file by using the values in this example `.eyas.config.js`. Example overrides are provided as comments.

```js
// <projectRoot>/.eyas.config.js
module.exports = {
  // From <projectRoot>, this is the path to your production output i.e. `npm run build` output
  source: `dist`,

  // Simulate a domain for the test (accepts '' || [''] || [{ url, title }])
  domains: [
    `eyas://local.test`
    /*
      { url: `dev.cycosoft.com`, title: `Development` },
      { url: `staging.cycosoft.com`, title: `Staging` },
      { url: `cycosoft.com`, title: `Production` } // Prod URLs are helpful, but under careful consideration.
    */
  ],

  // The name of your project
  title: ``,

  // The version of your project Eyas will be built from. You can alternatively set it to your package.json version for example.
  version: `<current-branch>.<current-commit>`,

  // Additional screen sizes to test your application at
  viewports: [/* { label: `iPad Pro`, width: 1024, height: 1366 } */],

  // Custom items for link menu with support for getting user input
  links: [/*
    { label: `Cycosoft, LLC`, url: `cycosoft.com`, external: true (open in browser) },
    { label: `Variables Demo`, url: `{testdomain}?id={int}&msg={str}&go={bool}&list={item1|item2|}` }
  */],

  // options for the test
  outputs: {
    // The number of hours from build time until the test expires
    expires: 168 // (range: 1-720 hours)
  }
};
```

## Usage

```bash
# Outputs `eyas.json` to your `config.source` directory for deployment to a web server
npm run build-my-project && npx eyas web
```

```bash
# Generates an Eyas test database for use with the installed version of Eyas
npm run build-my-project && npx eyas db
```

## Outputs

- `web`: Outputs `eyas.json` to your `config.source` directory for deployment to a web server
  - Requires end user to have Eyas [installed](https://github.com/cycosoft/Eyas/releases)
  - Share a link to _directory_ hosting the file as `eyas://branch-42.example.com/test`. Path cannot contain `eyas.json`, as Eyas will assume the path is a directory.
  - Requires a secure web server to host.
  - Recommended way to best control access to your tests. (e.g. delete source or require VPN)
  - View a demo at [https://launch.eyas.dev/demo.eyas.dev](https://launch.eyas.dev/demo.eyas.dev)
- `db`: Creates an `*.eyas` file of project production output + test config
  - Requires end user to have Eyas [installed](https://github.com/cycosoft/Eyas/releases)
  - Outputs to `./eyas-dist/`
  - About the size of the project production output
  - Recommended for end-users who do frequent testing, and do not have the benefit of hosting build artifacts on a server.


## Tips

- Add `eyas-*` to your `.gitignore` to prevent outputs from being committed to your repo
- View documented changes at [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
- While Eyas is intended to be used for testing in lower environments, testing fixes against production can be incredibly valuable when working directly with customers. It is advisable to use day-of time limits in these cases, and _very importantly_ that your test is branched *only* from the commit currently in production.
